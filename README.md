MVP for College Kitchen is to have a user enter the ingredient they have and the app will return a recipe and a how to make this video. There will also be videos available with basic cooking techniques.  If there are no results for the ingredients the user enters they will receive recipes that may only have one or two more ingredients.  Since my target demographic is college aged kids I will only return simple to cook recipes of which the cooking techniques are taught College Kitchen.
